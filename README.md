# GrimmsGUI2Word

**What is this project about?**
Select in the GUI the text of the popular Grimm Brothers' fairy tale you want generated. Once selected, the program will create and open a new word document (.docx) in your local folder with the selected fairy tale. You can find the document under **your local directory/FairyTale.docx**.

**How to use?**
Clone this repo and run the program.

**To consider**
With every new selection the generated document will be overwritten. If you want to save the document for further use, save it manually in another folder location.
